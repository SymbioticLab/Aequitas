// Used to ensure packets going out of a host do not exceed line rate;
// Gets constructed in Host's constructor.
// Basic idea:
//     NIC instructs Channels to send one packet each time based on the line rate,
//     The next recurring event gets triggered based on (packet_size / line_rate).
// Note that:
// (1) Channel no longer sends as many packets as the cwnd allows, but wait until the nic to say so.
//     Everytime only 1 packet gets sent. cwnd is still controlled by AggChannel.
// (2) We use Round-Robin among active channels when selecting the next Channel to send the packet.
// (3) Although the data packets are not generated until the NIC allows to send, the Ack packets
//     on the other hand is generated once data packet arrives, and thus needs to be put in a infinitely long queue.
//     Note: this feature is a TODO. Current impl is to do the Ack the old way given it won't affect the results too much.
// (4) The 'busy' variable is used to allow nic to rest when no packets are found instead of creating
//     too many useless events.
